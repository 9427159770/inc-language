The Modi Sarkar has ensured that instead of the envisaged ‘Single Rate of Tax’ we have five or six rates of tax, 0.25%, 3%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28% and 40%, with most goods and services falling in higher brackets like 18% and 28%. This was a deliberate distortion of the vision of the Congress, which according to former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was: “A ‘single’ GST rate means a standard rate as well as a standard plus rate (on demerit goods) and a standard minus rate (on merit goods).
